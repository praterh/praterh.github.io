		<p> Assignment One - <i>October 8th </i> </p>
		<p> I had a lot of fun with this assignment! It took me back to 8th grade when
		I first began my coding journey. It was a little difficult at first because it had
		been so long since I used HTML and CSS. I struggled mostly with formatting and layout,
		but through lectures and a lot of W3 Schools to help with syntax, it came back 
		to me fairly quickly. I wouldn't say that there were any concepts in this assignment that
		were entirely new to me, but I hadn't ever published a page to the web with an http URL,
		so that was cool to do for the first time. More than anything, this assignment has made me 
		much more excited for what's to come and what new concepts I will learn during this course. </p>

                <p> Assignment Two - <i>October 27th </i> </p>
                <p> This is one of the most creative assignments I've ever completed. I am aware that
                mocks have existed and continue to exist outside this course, but this was my first
                experience with them. I thought it was a lot of fun to try and match our starter html
                page to the mock with just CSS. I did struggle with this assignment much more than the
                last one, but I found that the resource that was the most helpful to me was the in
                class practice code on Github. I had to review layout and positionining styles and
                double check how they work as well as the occasional color or border keyword. Overall,
                I think it went smoothly and I had a lot of fun with it!
