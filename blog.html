		<p> Assignment One - <i>October 8th </i> </p>
		<p> I had a lot of fun with this assignment! It took me back to 8th grade when
		I first began my coding journey. It was a little difficult at first because it had
		been so long since I used HTML and CSS. I struggled mostly with formatting and layout,
		but through lectures and a lot of W3 Schools to help with syntax, it came back 
		to me fairly quickly. I wouldn't say that there were any concepts in this assignment that
		were entirely new to me, but I hadn't ever published a page to the web with an http URL,
		so that was cool to do for the first time. More than anything, this assignment has made me 
		much more excited for what's to come and what new concepts I will learn during this course. </p>
