			<h2> Bigger Questions </h2>

			<h4> What is the Most Interesting Thing I've Done with My Web Developement Skills? </h4>
			<p> When I was in my freshman year of highschool, my best friend and I entered an annual web 
			development competition called Code OR Create. We entered as the smallest and youngest team
			and called ourselves "The PeeWees". We ended up winning the competition, entering again the next
			year, and winning again! </p>

			<h4> What Do I Hope to Learn from This Class? </h4>
			<p> I used to use HTML and CSS a LOT when I first was learning how to code. I loved it, and that
			is what set me on the path to major in computer science. It has been years since I used 
			it, however, and my main goal in this class is to rekindle that knowledge and that love 
			for web developement. Specifically, I really hope to learn how to develop pages that are 
			more interactive, that are designed for a user to <i> actually </i> use. </p>

			<h4> Have I Signed Up for Ed? </h4>
			<p> Yes! I have signed up and viewed several posts. I am hoping to start answering some
			questions soon. </p>

			<h4> What is My Most Unique Experience? </h4>
			<p> During the COVID-19 quarantine, my house burnt down! (It's okay, you can laugh.) I 
			have said since then that it is the most interesting thing to have ever happened to me.
			It also made me much funnier. </p>
